## Example

Morpho Yield Optimizer is a strategy that is built using Brahma builder. It maximises userâ€™s Morpho positions by taking decisions on which vaults to choose based on APY; liquidity and TVL, on every rebalance.

For reference implementation, see [Morpho Optimizer Strategy](https://github.com/Brahma-fi/brahma-builder/blob/main/internal/usecase/workflows/activities/morpho/activity.go).
