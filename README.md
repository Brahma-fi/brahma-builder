# Brahma Builder

Scalable, high-performance workflow scheduling engine built on Temporal for executing custom strategies with the Brahma Builder Kit API. Seamlessly manages workflow orchestration, fault tolerance, and Brahma ecosystem integration.

## Features

- Zero-config workflow scheduling
- Automatic retry handling
- Native Brahma Builder Kit integration
- Temporal engine under the hood

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### Executor Interface
The primary interface for implementing custom strategies:
```go
type Executor interface {
    Execute(ctx context.Context, req *entity.ExecuteTaskReq) (*entity.ExecuteTaskResp, error)
}
```

#### Runtime Components
- **Temporal Scheduler**: Manages schedule creation and trigger handling
- **Activity Executor**: Handles strategy execution and lifecycle management
- **State Manager**: Maintains execution state and handles persistence
- **Error Handler**: Implements retry mechanisms and failure recovery

### Implementation Requirements

#### Strategy Development
1. Implement the `Executor` interface
2. Process incoming `ExecuteTaskReq`
3. Return execution results via `ExecuteTaskResp`

#### System Integration
- Strategies are automatically registered with Temporal
- Schedules are created based on subscription configurations
- Execution is triggered according to defined intervals

### Managed Components

#### Scheduling
- Schedule creation and management
- Trigger processing and distribution
- Execution window management

#### Execution
- Activity lifecycle management
- State persistence
- Error handling and retries
- Result processing

#### Resource Management
- Workload distribution
- Execution throttling
- Resource allocation

### Design Considerations

#### Strategy Implementation
- Implement atomic, single-responsibility strategies
- Utilize provided context for execution control
- Handle edge cases within strategy implementation
- Return structured responses via `ExecuteTaskResp`

#### Performance
- Strategies are executed as Temporal activities
- Built-in support for parallel execution
- Automatic resource scaling
